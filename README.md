## Features
* New game creates new random series of game play
* Each time you press the correct button, the game plays through the series plus a new move
* Each colour has its own sound that plays when the computer shows a move and when you press the correct move
* If you push the wrong button, a buzzer sounds, and the series plays for you to remind you of the game play series
* A counter keeps track of your moves
* If you hit "Start" during game play, the game will return to a single step with the same gameplay series
* You can play in Strict Mode where if you get a button press wrong, or hit Start, the game will restart with a new random series of game play
* You win after reaching 20 correct steps, with a sound notifying you of your victory
